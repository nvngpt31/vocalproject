Beginner Level Hindustani vocal plan for absolute beginners, optimized for your situation:
- Target ragas: Start with Yaman (gentle, user-friendly) and Bhairav (more gravitas, but manageable). If you prefer a lighter start, you can alternate with Kafi as needed.
- Available time: Morning (about 30–45 minutes per day)
- Accompaniment: Keyboard CASIO CTK2200 (use it for drone tanpura-like sound and simple rhythm/background accompaniment)

Your 8-week Beginner Schedule (Morning Sessions)

Week 1-2: Foundations (Breath, Posture, Sa Re Ga Ma, with Drone)
- Daily 30-40 minutes
- Setup:
  - Tanpura-like drone on Sa using CASIO CTK2200 (or use a dedicated tanpura app alongside if available)
  - Keyboard: use a subtle drone tempo and a soft pulse (metronome) to feel 4-beat or 16-beat cycle
- Focus:
  - Diaphragmatic breathing (5 minutes)
  - Posture and jaw/neck relaxation (5 minutes)
  - Lip trills, gentle hums, sirens (8-10 minutes)
  - Vocalize Sa Re Ga Ma with clear enunciation on drone (10-12 minutes)
- Home task: Record 1 minute singing Sa to Sa; note tone consistency

  - Introduction to Bandish in Yaman (lyrics optional): small phrases, simple pronunciation (5-8 minutes)
- Rhythm foundation:
  - Clap Teentaal for 1–2 cycles to feel pulse
- Keyboard use:
  - Keep drone on Sa; maybe add a light teentaal-like rhythm (no complex patterns yet)

Week 5-6: First Raga Focus (Yaman, possibly Bhairav as alternate)
- Daily 35-50 minutes
- Focus:
  - Review Sa Re Ga Ma with drone (5 minutes)
  - Raga selection: Yaman (primary) or Bhairav (alternate) depending on comfort
  - Learn 2–3 basic aroha/avaroha phrases for the chosen raga (10-15 minutes)

  - Bandish practice: 1 beginner-bandish in the chosen raga (lyrics optional) (10-15 minutes)

  - Listen to a short recording of the chosen raga and try to mimic intonation

Week 7-8: Rhythm & First Performance Prep (2–3 minute piece)
- Daily 40-55 minutes
- Focus:
  - Sargam + basic taali (rhythm with claps) (10 minutes)
  - Expand Bandish with a second line or a simple taan-like phrase (15 minutes)
  - Prepare a short performance segment:
    - 1 minute alap-like exploration (very simple)
    - 1 minute Bandish segment
    - 30 seconds basic taan-like phrase (slow and clear)
- Recording & review:
  - Record your 2–3 minute practice; review for intonation, rhythm, and expression

Suggested Bandishes for Beginners (keep lyrics optional at first)
- In Yaman: A simple Bandish like “Yaman Bandish (Sthayi only)” or a commonly taught beginner Bandish such as “Shuddha Kalyan” simplified for beginners
- In Bhairav (if you choose Bhairav as option): a simple Bandish arranged for beginners (lyrics optional)

How to Use CASIO CTK2200 Effectively
- Drone and tuning:
  - Use a soft, continuous drone on Sa. If possible, set a stable pitch reference (you can tune the keyboard to Sa and keep it steady)
- Rhythm and tempo:
  - Use the metronome to stay in a comfortable tempo (start around 60–72 BPM for Bandish learning, slow down if needed)
  - If the CTK2200 has an automatic accompaniment feature, use a very light tabla-like or drone pattern to internalize tala without overcomplicating
- Practice structure:
  - Use a fixed morning routine with a consistent start time
  - Keep the volume balanced so it doesn’t strain your voice

Core Concepts to Emphasize (Weeks 1–8)
- Breathing: diaphragmatic, even phrase length
- Posture: upright torso, relaxed shoulders
- Pitch accuracy: use drone; practice slow, precise intonation
- Pronunciation: clear sargam syllables; lyrics if used
- Raga mood: try to feel the basic emotion of the raga you’re practicing
- Simple ornamentation: light meend (glides) and kan (grace notes)

Weekly Checkpoints (End of Week 2, 4, 6, 8)
- Week 2: Can sing Sa Re Ga Ma with a steady drone tone
- Week 4: 1 Bandish introduced; basic rhythm feel established
- Week 6: 2 Bandish pieces attempted; intonation with drone improved
- Week 8: 2 Bandish pieces prepared; 2–3 minute practice with rhythm and drone integrated
